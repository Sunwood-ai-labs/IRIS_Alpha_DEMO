## 🚀 Setup Using uv

uv is a fast Python package installer and virtual environment manager. You can set up the project using uv by following these steps:

1. Install uv (if you haven't already):
   ```
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd IRIS_Alpha_DEMO
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment using uv:
   ```
   uv venv
   uv venv activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Now you have set up the project environment and installed dependencies using uv.
